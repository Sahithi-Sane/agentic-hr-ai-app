    "last_jd": "<think>\nOkay, I need to create a job description for an AI Engineer position. Let me start by understanding the requirements. The role requires 4 years of experience and specific skills like Python, SQL, Azure AI, LLM, RAG, and OpenAI. \n\nFirst, I'll draft a short company introduction. It should reflect a startup vibe, emphasizing innovation and cutting-edge AI solutions. Maybe something about being at the forefront of AI and transforming industries.\n\nNext, the role responsibilities. I need to detail what the AI Engineer will do. This includes developing AI models, working with Azure AI, implementing LLMs and RAG, collaborating with teams, optimizing models, and staying updated with AI trends. I should make sure each responsibility is clear and shows the impact of the role.\n\nFor required skills, I'll list the must-haves: Python, SQL, Azure AI, LLM, RAG, OpenAI, experience with AI/ML frameworks, cloud platforms, problem-solving, and communication skills. These should be concise and directly related to the job.\n\nThen, the nice-to-have skills. These could include advanced degrees in relevant fields, experience with specific AI tools like Hugging Face or TensorFlow, DevOps tools like Docker or Kubernetes, NLP experience, and a portfolio. These add extra value but aren't essential.\n\nFinally, the hiring timeline. It's a startup, so they might move quickly. Maybe 4-6 weeks from posting to onboarding.\n\nI should structure the job description with these sections, making sure it's professional yet appealing to candidates. I'll avoid jargon where possible and ensure each section flows logically. Let me put it all together now.\n</think>\n\n**Job Description: AI Engineer**\n\n**Company Introduction:**\nWe are an innovative startup at the forefront of AI technology, dedicated to revolutionizing industries through cutting-edge solutions.
